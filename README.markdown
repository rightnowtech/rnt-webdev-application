Final Notes
-----------
We're giving candidates lots of opportunities to show that they're the right one for the job, but do not get hung up on formatting the `etc/technology_ratings.html` file or tuning up your dot files for submission (or whatever).  It is better to submit *something* than to miss the opportunity while attempting perfection.  Do what you can, answer all of the questions in `etc/`, and we're looking forward to talking with you.
