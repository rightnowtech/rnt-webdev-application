Show Your Geek Creds
====================
Hard core developers don't work with default environments.  Instead they customize the heck out of their environments to become efficient.  In this directory, prove your geek creds by showing us how you customize your environment.  Add some commentary to a `description.txt` file if you want to clarify or explain anything.  Here are some ideas to get you started:

*  .bash_profile
*  bash functions and scripts
*  .vimrc
*  .screenrc
*  Services or applescripts tied to hotkeys (mac)
*  AutoHotkeys configs (windows)
*  .gitconfig
*  .gemrc
*  .irbrc
*  etc.
